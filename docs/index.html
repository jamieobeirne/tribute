     <p><em>"We are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of <strong>ourselves</strong>".</em></p>
     <p><em>"The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, "Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, "Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride."</em></p>
